    <h2>About</h2>
    
    <p>I live in Austin, TX for 3 years already. I am from Russia originally, so I speak russian and english languages. Before Austin, I lived in WA state for some years where I got a good experience as a QA analyst. At this moment, I am studying at the Code the Dream school.
        
    I love spending time with my husband and two little kids.  We love traveling together and eating good food.  At our free time, we ususally like to go outside and spend time at the pool, in park or  go somewhere with our friends.
    
    My dream is to become a good software developer. </p>
